## Tonight's TODOs
### Map entire 4th floor of engineering

### Running the navigation stack
- After map is made, run ```$ roslaunch trog_2dnav known_map.launch``` to run navigation stack in a known map. Goal is from lab to outside and back.
- Call ```rosservice call move_base/global_localization``` at beginning
- Then launch RViz. ```rosrun rviz rviz```
