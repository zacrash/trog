SETUP
1. Add an ethernet interface. (Do not set device. Ubuntu will automatically
configure this)
2. Set IP address to 192.168.1.1/200. (192.168.1.201 is reserved)

POSSIBLE BUGS

(Connected and data is all zero):
Wrong AC Adapter

(Connected, data is correct, but rostopic echo is empty):
Disable other network connections

(When trying to view data in RVIZ and you see "Fixed frame (map) does not exist"):
Call "$ rosrun rviz rviz -f velodyne" instead
